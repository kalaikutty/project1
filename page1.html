	 <strong>Whats app - Developed by  Brian Acton, Jan Koum</strong><img src='whatsapp.jpg' width='100px'></img>
	 <p>WhatsApp Messenger or simply WhatsApp is a freeware, cross-platform messaging and Voice over IP (VoIP)
	 service owned by Facebook, Inc. It allows users to send text messages and voice messages,
	 make voice and video calls, and share images, documents, user locations, and other media.
	 WhatsApp's client application runs on mobile devices but is also accessible from desktop computers,
	 as long as the user's mobile device remains connected to the Internet while they use the desktop app.
	 </p>
	 <strong>How it works</strong>
	 <p>The service requires users to provide a standard cellular mobile number for registering with the service.<br/>
	 In January 2018, WhatsApp released a standalone business app targeted at small business owners, called WhatsApp Business,
	 to allow companies to communicate with customers who use the standard WhatsApp client.</p>

	 <p>Facebook is an American online social media and social networking service based in Menlo Park,
	 California and a flagship service of the namesake company Facebook, Inc</p>
	 <p>The founders initially limited Facebook membership to Harvard students. Membership was expanded to Ivy League universities,
	 MIT, and higher education institutions in the Boston area, then various other universities, and lastly high school students. 
	 Since 2006, anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, 
	 though this may vary depending on local laws.
	 The name comes from the face book directories often given to American university students.</P>
	 <strong>How do we use it?</strong>
	 <p>The Facebook service can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, such as personal computers, tablets and smartphones.
	 After registering, users can create a profile revealing information about themselves. 
	 They can post text, photos and multimedia which is shared with any other users that have agreed to be their "friend", or, with a <br/>
	 different privacy setting, with any reader. Users can also use various embedded apps, join common-interest groups, buy and sell <br/>
	 items or services on Marketplace, and receive notifications of their Facebook friends' activities and activities of Facebook pages they follow. 
	 Facebook claimed that it had more than 2.3 billion monthly active users as of December 2018.
