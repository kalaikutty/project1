	<strong>About Social Media</strong>
	 <p>Social media are interactive computer-mediated technologies that facilitate the creation or sharing of information, ideas,
	 career interests and other forms of expression via virtual communities and networks. The variety of stand-alone
	 and built-in social media services currently available introduces challenges of definition; however, there are some common features</P>
	 
	 <p>Users usually access social media services via web-based technologies on desktops and laptops,
	 or download services that offer social media functionality to their mobile devices <br/>(e.g., smartphones and tablets).
	 As users engage with these electronic services, they create highly interactive platforms through which individuals, communities, and organizations <br/>
	 can share, co-create, discuss, participate and modify user-generated content or self-curated content posted online.</p>

	 They "introduce substantial and pervasive changes to communication between organizations, communities, and individuals.
	 These changes are the focus of the emerging fields of technoself studies. Social media differ from paper-based media <br/>
	 (e.g., magazines and newspapers) and traditional electronic media such as TV broadcasting, Radio broadcasting in many ways, including quality,
	 reach, frequency, interactivity, usability, immediacy, and performance. Social media outlets operate in a dialogic transmission system
	 (many sources to many receivers). This is in contrast to traditional media which operates under a mono-logic transmission model
	 (one source to many receivers), such as a newspaper which is delivered to many subscribers, or a radio station which broadcasts the
	 same programs to an entire city. Some of the most popular social media websites, with over 100 million registered users, include Facebook 
	 (and its associated Facebook Messenger),
	 YouTube,Instagram,Twitter, Tumblr, Telegram, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, LINE, Snapchat, Pinterest and more.
